# STM32_ADC
This is a simple configuration of ADC for an STM32F407-VG.
I have used channel 11 of ADC3 (PIN PC1 on the discovery board) to manipulate the 4 LED on the board.
Only ST documents have been used here (bare-metal code). 
Development environment: STM32CubeIDE, but it should work on any IDE.
